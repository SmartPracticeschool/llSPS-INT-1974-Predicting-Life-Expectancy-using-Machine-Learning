Predicting Life Expectancy Using Machine Learning
==============================================================
 
Project Summary:
=============================================================
Life expectancy is a statistical measure of the average time a human being is expected to live, Life expectancy depends on various factors: Regional variations, Economic Circumstances,  Sex Differences, Mental Illnesses, Physical Illnesses, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors.
